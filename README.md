This gets data from the Bayside City Council website.

I have my scraper working but not all the required data can be collected as the links are dynamically generated.

Data from the website is all generated for each session. This means links are not going to work.

This is a scraper that runs on [Morph](https://morph.io). To get started [see the documentation](https://morph.io/documentation)
